# Second_task

## Installation

I'm using Vite

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the app.

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## For task:

 - Register and Sign in requests in useForm hook (src/components/SignForm/hooks/useForm.js)

 - Get products request in CatalogBlock component (src/components/CatalogBlock/CatalogBlock.jsx)

 - Get user info request in Cabinet component (src/components/Cabinet/Cabinet.jsx)

All using tan-stack query

P.S. Redux was used, because it will be mandatory in our final project
